A simple utility that will ask X11 to minimize all the active windows so you
can see the desktop.

This is useful in situations where you'd like to programmatically toggle the
visibility of the desktop. In my particular scenario, I use this as part of
a larger script that's bound to a keyboard shortcut - it fires up a number
of smaller widget-like programs on the desktop, which provides a similar
functionality as the Mac OS dashboard feature.

I did not write this code. I borrowed it from this page:
